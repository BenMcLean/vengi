# Basics

## Build

See [compilation](Compilation.md) and [dependencies](Dependencies.md).

## Coordinate system

We are using the default opengl right handed coordinate system with x going right, y going upwards and z point towards you.

We are using column major matrices.

## Unittests

If you are going to contribute, make sure that you are adding unittests, too. I won't make promises about not breaking anything
if there aren't unittests that are telling me that I've broken something.

To add a unittest, each module (`src/modules/XXX`) has a `tests/` subdirectory. The `CMakeLists.txt` in the module directory adds the source files from that folder.

```cmake
set(TEST_SRCS
  [...]
)
gtest_suite_begin(tests-${LIB} TEMPLATE ${ROOT_DIR}/src/modules/core/tests/main.cpp.in)
gtest_suite_sources(tests-${LIB} ${TEST_SRCS})
gtest_suite_deps(tests-${LIB} ${LIB})
gtest_suite_end(tests-${LIB})
```

## Coding style

Rule of thumb - stick to the existing coding style - you can also use the `clang-format` settings to format your code. In general
you should not include any whitespace or formatting changes if they don't belong to your code changes.

If you do a formatting change, this should not be mixed with code changes - make a dedicated commit for the formatting.

Avoid using the STL were possible - see [Orthodox C++](https://gist.github.com/bkaradzic/2e39896bc7d8c34e042b).

## Commit messages

Commit messages should match the usual git commit message guidelines. Keep the summary short - put an UPPERCASE prefix in front
of it and try to explain why the change was made - not what you changed (because that is part of the commit diff already).

The prefix is usually the module name. E.g. if you are changing code in `src/modules/voxelformat` the prefix would be `VOXELFORMAT`. A commit message could look like this:

```
VOXELFORMAT: summary

detail message line 1
detail message line 2
```
