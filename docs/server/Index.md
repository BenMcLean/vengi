# Server

## Architecture

TODO: document server architecture, world, map, ai-zone, chunk management, user handling

## Network

TODO: document network stuff like cvar replication, protocol (flatbuffer) stuff, login, logout
and so on

## General

**Hint**: In order to start the server you will need to setup the postgres database. See
the setup documentation for more details.

After starting the server, you will get entities spawned in the world. You can use e.g. the
ai remote debugger (`src/tools/rcon`) to inspect the state or use the client to connect.

To specify the database that should be used use the config bars **db_name**, **db_host**, **db_pw** and **db_user**.
For example:

```bash
./vengi-owserver -set db_host 192.168.0.1 -set db_post 5432 -db_name vengi -db_pw engine
```

For the client connect you need a user in the database. You can create users with a server
command called `sv_createuser`.

To get a list of available commands, you can use cmdlist in the server terminal.

## Chunk download

The chunks are persisted in the database and can be made available via cdn or any other http
server. The gameserver has a built-in http server, too. If you want to use any other http server,
you have to set it via `sv_httpchunkurl` like this:

```bash
./vengi-owserver -set sv_httpchunkurl http://myhostname:8080/mychunkurl
```

... or export the environment variable `SV_HTTPCHUNKURL` or add it to your config file (see
setup documentation for more details).

This cvar is one of those that is automatically replicated to the client. Whenever you change it,
all clients will be notified about it and use the new url.

The http endpoint reads several GET paramters:

* `x`, `y`, `z`: The chunk coordinates
* `mapid`
You will find these values in the `chunk` database table. A custom chunk endpoint just would have to
send the database blob with a content type of `application/chunk`.

## Docker

The docker image is using apt-cacher-ng (<https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-apt-cacher-ng>)

Make sure to have this running on your docker host

```bash
docker run --name apt-cacher-ng --init -d --restart=always \
  --publish 3142:3142 \
  --volume /srv/docker/apt-cacher-ng:/var/cache/apt-cacher-ng \
  sameersbn/apt-cacher-ng:3.1-1
```
