Create thumbnailer images of all supported voxel formats. In combination with a mimetype definition and a `.thumbnailer` definition file
that must be installed in `/usr/share/mime/packages` and `/usr/share/thumbnailer` this will e.g. create small preview images for the [supported voxel formats](../Formats.md).

It works for any file manager that supports `.thumbnailer` entries, including Nautilus, Thunar (when tumbler is installed), Nemo, Caja,
and PCManFM.
