.SH NAME
@COMMANDLINE@ \- convert voxel volume formats or export as mesh

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fB@NAME@\fR [\fIoption\fR] --input infile --output outfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB@COMMANDLINE@\fP is a command line application that can convert several voxel
volume formats into others. Supported formats are e.g. cub (CubeWorld), qb/qbt
(Qubicle), vox (MagicaVoxel), vmx (VoxEdit Sandbox), kvx (Build engine), kv6 (SLAB6),
binvox and others. It can also export to mesh formats like obj and ply with a number
of options.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\--trace|--debug|--info\fR
Enable trace, debug or info logging

.TP
\fB\--merge|-m\fR
Merge all layers into one. Some destination formats only support one layer - for
those formats this is an explicit parameter. If you are going to export to a mesh
format like wavefront obj, this option changes the behaviour of the exporter, too.

.TP
\fB\--scale|-s\fR
Save the target volume with a down-sampled version of the input volume.

.TP
\fB\-set <varname> <value>\fR
Change the value of a config variable. \fB-set palette /path/to/palette.png\fR is
going to use a different palette for importing and exporting the voxels. It should
have the dimensions 1x256.

.TP
\fB\--version|-v\fR
Print the version of the application.

.TP
\fB\--help\fR
Print usage information with a a full list of cvars
